spawned by what?
3den, Zeus, scripted, magic?
because the first 2 have EH's, the third one... you can do yourself and the last one doesn't exist

Dunno. But I know that the alternative syntax works.
You can try that too. If it returns an empty string as well, check your code, otherwise make a ticket on FT.

I think you simply need the  init. 
The syntax was something like :
[class, "init", code] call CBA_fnc_addClassEventHandler
Not sure
Also not sure about a group version

will trigger for all objects (and for each object in a group) when spawned by Zeus

//TODO: 
create eventhandler that catches all spawned units
- zeus spawned
- eden spawned
- script spawned
//have init that adds EH
